Callbacks
---------

Callbacks are used to request information from a specific implementation.
They can be used to process the passed information and present a result to the peer.
Only one function can be registered for one callback.

The process will wait for the callback to return the result of the calculation.
Because of that the callback should run as performant as possible.

There are three ways to define the callback functions, by creating them in the `inherited handler`_,
by setting a `target object`_  and
by `registering callbacks`_.
Registered callbacks supersede target and overridden functions.

Inherited handler
+++++++++++++++++

When working with a inherited class, callbacks can be implemented by creating callback members with a specific name::

    class SampleHost(secsgem.gem.GemHostHandler):
        def _on_alarm_received(self, handler, ALID, ALCD, ALTX):
            return ACKC5.ACCEPTED

In this example when an alarm was received (callback name is alarm_received) the :code:`_on_alarm_received` method will be called.
The result (in this case :code:`ACKC5.ACCEPTED`) will be passed to the equipment sending the alarm.

A generic representation of the function would be::

    def _on_<callback_name>(self, handler, <parameters>):
        return <result>


Callbacks for streams/functions can also be overridden this way by following a specific naming::

    def _on_s05f01(self, handler, message):
        return self.stream_function(5, 2)(ACKC5.ACCEPTED)

Note that the stream and function numbers are formatted to have a leading zero if they are only one character long.
In this case the reply stream/function must be returned.

Target object
+++++++++++++

These methods don't need to be implemented on the handler itself.
Another object can also be registered using the callbacks member names of the handler.
The :code:`_on_<callback_name>` methods are then searched in that object::

    class TestClass:
        def _on_alarm_received(self, handler, ALID, ALCD, ALTX):
            return ACKC5.ACCEPTED

    t = TestClass()

    handler.callbacks.target = t

Registering callbacks
+++++++++++++++++++++

Callbacks can also be registered from outside a class::

    def f_alarm_received(handler, ALID, ALCD, ALTX):
        return ACKC5.ACCEPTED

    handler.callbacks.alarm_received = f_alarm_received

To unregister simply clear the member::

    handler.callbacks.alarm_received = None
